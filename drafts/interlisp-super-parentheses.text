Super-parentheses in Interlisp
------------------------------

(let* [(x 1) (y (+ x 3] (+ x y)) is syntactically valid in Interlisp,

The [ creates an "anchor", the ] then closes as many parentheses as
necessary to go back to that level.

They can be nested too.

The [ and ] are not just keyboard commands in the editor user
interface, they are actually saved as such into the source file.

However, the "new" sedit editor doesn't support inserting them. It
converts them to normal parentheses.
